This sequence creator takes in input in the tester file and outputs it into the terminal into the desired list the user needs.
The output is in the format of either an Arithmetic, Geometric or Quadratic format. 


An arithmetic sequence, is a sequence of numbers such that the 
difference between consecutive terms is constant. This constant is referred
to as the common difference. Any arithmetic sequence can be defined as a 
linear function of the form f(n) = a1 + (n-1)d, where a1 is the first term,
d is the common difference, and the domain n is the natural numbers 
{1,2,3,..}

A geometric sequence, is a sequence of numbers where each term after the
first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number 
called the common ratio. Any geometric sequence can be defined as an 
exponential function of the form f(n) = a1(r)^n, where a1 is the first 
term, r is the common ratio raised to the n power, and the domain n is 
the whole numbers {0,1,2,3,..} 

A quadratic sequence, is a sequence of numbers in which the second 
differences between each consecutive term differ by the same amount, 
called a common second difference. Any geometric sequence can be defined 
as a quadratic function of the form f(n) = An^2 + Bn + C, where A, B, and
C are constants, and n^2 means n raised to the 2nd power.
